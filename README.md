A radically modular energy solution: Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) embedded 50 meters underground

Global Electrification Energy Demand: Hard Numbers First

As of 2024, global electricity generation is approximately 30,850 TWh/year.

Replacing all internal combustion vehicles worldwide with electric vehicles is estimated to increase electricity demand by 30%, due to:
	•	Vehicle efficiency conversion
	•	Battery charging and energy storage losses
	•	Climate and terrain-related usage variation

30% of 30,850 TWh = ~9,250 TWh/year additional global electricity demand.

A standard nuclear power plant (1 GW electric, 90% capacity factor) generates approximately:

1 GW × 24 hrs/day × 365 days × 0.9 = 7.9 TWh/year, commonly rounded to 8 TWh/year

To meet the 9,250 TWh demand:

9,250 ÷ 8 = ~1,156 new reactors required

This excludes rising demand from AI computation, industry electrification, or climate adaptation systems.

At present, the world has around 440 operational reactors. Constructing 1,150+ more, under current regulatory and logistical conditions, would take decades, not years.

Executive Summary

So, we conclude ....that replacing all internal combustion vehicles globally with electric vehicles would require the equivalent output of 1000 (Thousand) traditional nuclear power plants.

This is technically feasible—but logistically and politically implausible within the next decade, due to:
	•	Regulatory hurdles
	•	Complex safety certification
	•	Manufacturing bottlenecks (e.g. reactor cores, steam turbines, transformers)

The Realistic Alternative: NukeX

We propose a radically modular energy solution:
Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) embedded 50 meters underground, operating with:
	•	Passive cooling and fail-safe design
	•	Enclosed, tamper-resistant shielding
	•	Autonomy-focused deployment models

https://www.iaea.org/topics/small-modular-reactors

These reactors:
	•	Require no on-site maintenance for up to 10 years
	•	Can power mid-sized communities or industrial clusters
	•	Offer a decentralized rollout model: one unit, one node, total independence

⸻

The Deployment Model

Governments will not get this done in time.
Only hyper-capitalized private entities can break ground fast enough.

NukeX isn’t just a reactor — it’s a survival node with:
	•	Energy
	•	Shelter
	•	Water
	•	Food (powered hydroponics)

Everything needed for resilience in the next energy paradigm.

The Brand

NukeX captures the urgency and autonomy of a new energy era
